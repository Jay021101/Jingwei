Github Flow Practise
Hi, i am Jingwei. Currently studying Material Science and Engineering in NTU,
Year 3(2024).
Decided to learn AI due to my course offering Materials & AI as a specialisation.
Together with my girlfriend since 29/03/2024 officially.
I am Singaporean and my girlfriend is Vietnamese.
My goal is to get into MIT to learn more about Materials and AI applications for them, MIT being the pioneer of innovation will provide me with a whole new experience compared to NTU.
Currently interning in GlobalFoundries, learning Excel VBA, Power BI, DAX and M code for power query. 
Have edited videos before for tutorials for new hires in GlobalFoundries.
